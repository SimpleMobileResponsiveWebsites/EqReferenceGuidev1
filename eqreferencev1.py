    ### Tips for Using This Guide
    - These frequencies are approximate and may need adjustment based on:
        - The specific instrument
        - The player's style
        - The recording environment
        - The overall mix context
    - Use your ears as the final judge
    - Make subtle adjustments rather than dramatic ones
